# Blockland's Default Scripts Decompiled

These scripts were decompiled using [DSO Sharp](https://github.com/Elletra/dso-sharp), my DSO decompiler. They are logically and functionally accurate, but they ain't pretty. Decompilation, particularly for DSOs, is tricky and will produce some _unconventional_ code...

So far there are four versions decompiled: [Retail Beta](https://bl.kenko.dev/Versions/Retail%20Beta/), v1, v20, and v21 (current revision)
